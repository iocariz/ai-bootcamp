You can also learn more in the [release blog](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/evidently-api-change).\\n\\n### Data Definition\\n\\nWe replaced `column_mapping` with `data_definition`. Now, you also need to explicitly create an Evidently `Dataset` object instead of just passing a dataframe when running a Report. Each `Dataset` object has an associated `DataDefinition`.\\n\\nWhile similar to column mapping, this new structure lets you cleanly map input columns based on their **type** (e.g., categorical, numerical, datetime, text) and **role** (e.g., target, prediction, timestamp). A column can have both a type and role.\\n\\nYou can also now map **multiple targets and predictions** inside the same table: e.g., if you deal with multiple regression or have several classification results in one table.\\n\\nAutomated column type/role mapping is still available. Additionally, new mappings for LLM use cases, like RAG, will be supported.\\n\\n<Card title=\"Data Definition\" href=\"/docs/library/data_definition\">\\n  Docs on mapping the input data.\\n</Card>\\n\\n### Descriptors\\n\\nDescriptors provide row-level text evaluations, ranging from basic checks (e.g., text length) to LLM-based evals (e.g., checking for contradictions). With the increasing focus on LLM-related metrics, weâ€™ve updated the text descriptors API to make it more logical and easier to use.\\n\\nDescriptor computation is now split into **two steps**:\\n\\n**1. Compute Descriptors**. Add them to the source table containing inputs and outputs. You can do this together with data definition. For example:\\n\\n```python\\neval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\n    data_definition=DataDefinition(\\n        text_columns=[\"question\", \"answer\"]),\\n    descriptors=[\\n        Sentiment(\"answer\", alias=\"Sentiment\"),\\n        TextLength(\"answer\", alias=\"Length\"),\\n        IncludesWords(\"answer\", words_list=[\\'sorry\\', \\'apologize\\'], alias=\"Denials\"),\\n    ]\\n)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Aggregate results or run conditional checks**. Use these descriptors like any other dataset column when creating a Report. For example, here is how you summarize all descriptors and check that the text length is under 100 symbols.\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals(),\\n    MaxValue(column=\"Length\", tests=[lt(100)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis decoupling means you can reuse descriptor outputs for multiple tests or aggregations without recomputation. Itâ€™s especially useful for LLM evaluations.\\n\\n<Card title=\"Descriptors\" href=\"/docs/library/descriptors\">\\n  Docs on adding descriptors.\\n</Card>\\n\\n### New Reports API\\n\\nAs you may have noticed in the example above, we made the changes to the core Report API. Here is how generating a Report with data summary preset for a single dataset works now:\\n\\n```python\\neval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(source_df),\\n    data_definition=DataDefinition()\\n)\\n\\nreport = Report([\\n    DataSummaryPreset()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_data, None)\\n```\\n\\nKey changes:\\n\\n- The Report object now defines the configuration (e.g., metrics to include).\\n- Running a Report returns a separate result object.\\n\\n<Card title=\"Reports\" href=\"/docs/library/report\">\\n  How to generate Reports.\\n</Card>\\n\\nAdditional improvement: you can also now use \"Group by\" to compute metrics for specific segments.\\n\\n### Test Suites joined with Reports\\n\\nMost importantly,  Reports and Tests are now unified. Previously, these were separate:\\n\\n- Reports provided an overview of metrics (e.g., distribution summaries, statistics).\\n- Tests verify pass/fail conditions (e.g., check for missing data or LLM quality thresholds).\\n\\nNow, the Test Suite mode is an optional extension of a Report. If you choose to enable Tests, their results appear as a separate tab in the same HTML file. This eliminated duplication and the need to switch between separate files or Reports.\\n\\nFor example, here is how you add a Test on max length that will appear in the same Report as all data / column statistics.\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n     DataSummaryPreset(),\\n     MaxValue(column=\"Length\", tests=[lt(100)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nYou can still use auto-generated Test conditions based on your reference dataset or define your own expectations.\\n\\n<Card title=\"Tests\" href=\"/docs/library/tests\">\\n  How to add Tests with conditions.\\n</Card>\\n\\n### Metric redesign\\n\\nThe Metric object has been simplified:\\n\\n- Metrics now produce a single computation result with a fixed structure.\\n- Some visualization types can be specified directly as parameters to the Metric.\\n\\nThis redesign significantly improves JSON result parsing and UI integration, since each Metric has a single or two results only.\\n\\nYou can check the list of new Metrics here:\\n\\n<Card title=\"Metrics\" href=\"/metrics/all-metrics\">\\n  All available Metrics.\\n</Card>\\n\\nTo get a pre-built combination of multiple checks at once, you can still use Presets.\\n\\n### Simplified Dashboard API\\n\\nWith the redesigned Metrics, the Dashboard API is now much, much simpler. You can create new panels and point to specific Metric results with a strictly fixed set of options.\\n\\n<Card title=\"Dashboard\" href=\"/docs/platform/dashboard_add_panels\">\\n  How to add Dashboard panels.\\n</Card>\\n\\nAdditional improvement: custom metrics with custom renders are now viewable in the UI, which was not previously supported.',\n",

Some Metrics like `MissingValueCount` or `CategoryCount` return both absolute counts and percentage. The default `tests` parameter lets you set condition against the absolute value. To test the relative value, use `share_tests` parameter.\\n\\nTo test for fewer than 5 missing values (absolute):\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    MissingValueCount(column=\"Age\", tests=[lte(5)])\\n])\\n```\\n\\nTo test for less than 10% missing values (relative):\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    MissingValueCount(column=\"Age\", share_tests=[lte(0.1)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\n### Tests relative to reference\\n\\n**Testing against reference**. If you pass a reference dataset, you can set conditions relative to the reference values. For example, to Test that the number of rows in the current dataset is equal or greater than the reference number of rows +/- 10%:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom evidently.future.tests import Reference\\n\\nreport = Report([\\n   RowCount(tests=[gte(Reference(relative=0.1))]),\\n])\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_data_1, eval_data_2)\\n```\\n\\nYou can also define the absolute difference from reference:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n   RowCount(tests=[gte(Reference(absolute=5))]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis checks that the the number of rows is greater or equal to reference +/-5.\\n\\n### Set Test criticality\\n\\nBy default, failed Tests return Fail. To get a Warning instead, set `is_critical=False`: \\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    MissingValueCount(column=\"Age\", share_tests=[eq(0, is_critical=False)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis helps manage alert fatigue and prioritize Tests. If you [set alerts](/docs/platform/alerts) on failed Tests, the \"Warning\" result won\\'t trigger an alert. Warnings are labeled yellow.\\n\\nYou can also use this to set \"layered\" conditions. For example, get a Warning for any missing values, Fail if over 10%:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    MissingValueCount(column=\"Age\", \\n                      share_',\n",

      "### Steps to Build an Eval Report with LLM as a Judge\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n",
      "   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. For example, you might need the `evidently` library for generating reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install evidently\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Import Required Modules**:\n",
      "   Import all the modules you will need for data handling, metrics, and report generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import pandas as pd\n",
      "   from evidently import Dataset, Report\n",
      "   from evidently.descriptors import LLMEval\n",
      "   from evidently.llm.templates import BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Set Up OpenAI API Key**:\n",
      "   You need an OpenAI API key to use the LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   import os\n",
      "   os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"YOUR_KEY\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Create the Evaluation Dataset**:\n",
      "   Prepare a dataset containing the questions, target responses, new responses, and manual labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   # Sample data\n",
      "   data = [\n",
      "       [\"Question 1\", \"Correct response\", \"User's answer\", \"incorrect\", \"Reason\"],\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Generate the Evaluation Report**:\n",
      "   Use the `Report` functionality from the `evidently` library to create and run the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   report = Report([TextEvals()])\n",
      "   my_eval = report.run(eval_dataset, None)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **View and Export the Results**:\n",
      "   Summarize and visualize the results. You can use various formats like JSON or HTML, or simply view them in your notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   # Display evaluation results\n",
      "   print(my_eval)\n",
      "\n",
      "   # Export as HTML or JSON\n",
      "   my_eval.json()\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Analyze the Evaluation**:\n",
      "   Evaluate the quality of the LLM judge by comparing its output against the ground truth labels, exploring metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   from evidently.metrics import ClassificationPreset\n",
      "   \n",
      "   # Set up the report for quality evaluation\n",
      "   quality_report = Report([ClassificationPreset()])\n",
      "   quality_eval = quality_report.run(eval_dataset, None)\n",
      "   print(quality_eval)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This approach demonstrates how to create an evaluation report using an LLM as a judge. You can iterate on the evaluation criteria and the model used based on performance to refine your dataset and achieve better results. Further integrations may include uploading the results to an external platform for richer exploration.\n",
